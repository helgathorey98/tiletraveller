#Algoritm:
# Player starts in tile [1,1] from this tile the user can only go north. From [1,2] he can go all directions except 
# west. [1,1], [2,1] and [3,1] are the same because they can only go one north. [2,2] and [3,3] are the same because 
# they can go south and west.[1,3] can go south and east. [2,3] can go west and east. 
# We need to take in each tile starting from [1,1] and we inform the user which directions are possible and then he 
# can choose which direction he will go to. If he chooses an invalid direction we will inform him about that.
